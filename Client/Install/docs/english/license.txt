2. GRANT OF LICENSE.  This License Agreement permits you to use one copy of Cosmi software including but not limited to the software included with this product or downloaded from the internet or other electronic communication medium, together with all related documentation and accompanying items including, but not limited to, the executable programs, drivers, libraries and data files associated with such programs (collectively, the "Software"), on a single computer/workstation. The Software is "in use" on a computer when it is loaded into the temporary memory (i.e., RAM or Cache) or installed into permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM drive, or other storage device) of that computer. This License does not constitute a sale and does not authorize a sale of the Software or anything created thereby. All intellectual property (including copyright, trademark and patent) in the Software, including all animations, audio, images, maps, music, photographs, video, and text incorporated into the Software, are owned by Cosmi and its affiliates, suppliers and licensors, and are protected by United States laws and international treaty provisions.  Cosmi and its affiliates, suppliers and licensors retain all rights not expressly granted. You must treat the Software like any other copyrighted material, except that you may make one copy of the Software solely for backup or archival purposes. You may transfer the machine-readable portion of the Software from one computer to another computer, provided that a) the Software (including any portion or copy thereof) is erased from the first computer, and b) there is no possibility that the Software will be used on more than one computer at a time.  A computer is defined both by the physical computer and the operating system installation.  Therefore, a single physical computer with multiple operating systems installed will be recognized as one computer for each operating system.  However, you may not transfer your license of the Software to any third party.

- You may not use the software on or over a network or any other transfer device (including the Internet) except in a manner using the network and online functions included in the Software, if any. Use of the Software on more than one computer constitutes copyright infringement and may be punishable by civil fines, criminal penalties, or both.
- You may not rent or lease the Software, but schools and libraries may lend the Software to third parties provided the Software is in CD format and each end user is given a copy of this License Agreement which will govern the use of such Software. 
- You may not modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Software, except to the extent that this restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law.
- You may not remove any proprietary notices or labels in the Software.
- You may not copy the printed materials accompanying the Software or distribute printed copies of any user documentation provided in electronic format.
- You may not publicly perform or publicly display the Software.
	
The restrictions contained herein apply equally to hybrid CD-ROMs or DVD-ROMs which may contain multiple versions of the Software for use on different operating systems.  Regardless of the type of media you receive, you may use only the portion appropriate for your single-user computer/workstation. In the event you fail to comply with any of the terms or conditions of this license, your rights to use the Software will end, you will stop using the Software, remove the Software from your computer, and permanently erase all copies of the Software. You acknowledge that none of the Software or underlying information or technology may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, North Korea, Iran, Syria or any other country subject to a U.S. embargo; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S.  Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Denied Parties List or Entity List.  By using the Software you are agreeing to the foregoing and are representing and warranting that (i) no U.S. federal agency has suspended, revoked, or denied you export privileges, (ii) you are not located in or under the control of a national or resident of any such country or on any such list, and (iii) you will not export or re-export the Software to any prohibited county, or to any prohibited person, entity, or end-user as specified by U.S. export controls.

3. TRIAL.  If you are using the Software on a trial basis, and are authorized to do so, then you shall have a license under this Agreement to use the Software for the number of days indicated in the materials accompany the Software, or in the event this Software was obtained as part of a download for the period indicated on the site where the Software was downloaded from, (the "Trial Period") from the date you install it, solely for the purpose of evaluating the Software to determine whether to purchase an ongoing license to the Software.  At the end of the Trial Period, the Software will stop working and the license granted herein shall immediately terminate.

5. REMEDIES.  Your exclusive remedy will be, at Cosmi’s sole option, (a) the refund of the amount you paid for the Software or (b) repair or replacement of the Software, provided that the defective Software is returned to Cosmi (at Cosmi, 14650 Hoover St., Westminster, CA  92683) along with proof of the date of purchase within thirty (30) days from the date of purchase. This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the Software has resulted from accident, abuse, neglect or misapplication. Any replacement Software will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer. Except as set forth above, the Software is sold "as-is", without any express or implied warranties of any kind.

IN NO EVENT WILL COSMI’S AND ITS AFFILIATES’, SUPPLIERS’ AND LICENSORS’ LIABILITY EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU FOR THE SOFTWARE REGARDLESS OF THE FORM OF THE CLAIM (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CONTRACT, PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR TORT CLAIM). BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. FURTHER, COSMI SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR THE ACCURACY OF ANY INFORMATION PROVIDED BY COSMI OR THIRD-PARTY TECHNICAL SUPPORT PERSONNEL, OR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY, BY ACTS TAKEN OR OMISSIONS MADE BY YOU AS A RESULT OF SUCH TECHNICAL SUPPORT.
