-------------------
Game Control Issues
-------------------

------------------------
Sliders in Options Menus
------------------------
Sliders in option menus move with greater precision when using
the mouse to adjust the slider than when using the keyboard.

--------------------
Double Tap Maneuvers
--------------------
For shortcut purposes, and more intuitive gameplay, boost and
sprint can be initiated by double tapping the forward [W] key.
This will work on any infantry unit, vehicle, or starfighter
capable of utilizing boost or sprint. Starfighters can also
perform basic stunts through double tapping the other movement
keys. Double tapping Roll Clockwise [D] or Roll Counterclockwise
[A] will initiate a right or left barrel roll, respectively.
Double tapping backward [S] will perform an Immelmann maneuver.

---------------------------------
Optimal Configuration Suggestions
---------------------------------

------
Flying
------
If you are experiencing any difficulty flying, we suggest that you
remap your key configuration to allow for better turning ability
and reduce the disorientation that can be caused by roll.

* Remap TURN LEFT to ‘A’
* Remap TURN RIGHT to ‘D’
* Remap TRICK to ‘C’
* Remap ROLL LOCK to ‘LEFT CTRL’

--------
Infantry
--------
If you enjoy using ROLL a lot, you may want to consider remapping
the LEFT CTRL key to ROLL LOCK.

---------------------------
Joystick and Gamepad Issues
---------------------------

----------------------------------
Mapping Buttons in Control Options
----------------------------------
You must map the buttons on your game controller in the Control
Options menu before you will be able to use your game controller
in STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT II.

---------------------------
Setting Up Game Controllers
---------------------------
To use your game controller in STAR WARS BATTLEFRONT II, you 
will need to setup the game controls in the Control Options
screen.

The Control Options screen is separated into five sections
highlighted by tabs at the top. You must setup your controls
in each of these sections separately as there are different
control schemes for being on-foot (Infantry), being in a
vehicle such as a Speeder Bike or AT-ST Walker (Vehicle), 
being in a flying vehicle such as a X-Wing or TIE Fighter
(Starfighter), being a Jedi such as Luke Skywalker or 
Darth Vader (Jedi), and being in a turret such as the 
secondary position in an AT-TE (Turret).

Please note that even though it is considered an infantry unit,
the CIS Droideka is considered a vehicle in terms of control
scheme.

Also note that even though transports, such as the Republic
Gunship and Imperial Transport, are considered flyers, they
do not have the ability to perform tricks like the other
three classes of flyers.

To set a control configuration, simply highlight the control
you wish to set and click on it once with the left mouse button.
A prompt will appear stating Press New Key, ESC to Cancel. 
Press the button on your game controller that you want to
assign for that control, or press the Escape key if you change
your mind.

Important! If your controller has any kind of throttle, rotary
dial, rudder or slider control you will want to set it to zero
before assigning any controls. Otherwise, the game will read
your throttle, rotary dial, or slider as being active and set
the intended control assignment to the control. Because of
differences in the different controller configurations on the
market, the zero point for these controls may be different
(either at the lowest possible setting or at the halfway
setting).

-----------------------
Binding A Joystick Axis
-----------------------
When binding the Pitch Up/Down Axis in the Starfighter Config
Bindings section, it should be set to "Joystick Y -", which is
done by pushing the joystick up. If it is set to "Joystick Y +",
the Pitch setting will be inverted, making the Invert Y Axis
configuration option backward. No will be inverted and Yes will
not.

You are limited to assigning a total of two bindings for each
control. If you make a mistake and wish to reset all the
controls to their original state, click on Reset To Defaults
at the bottom of the screen.

------------------------------
Character Moving Without Input
------------------------------
Your mouse pointer and/or player character may move in the game
without any user input when you have a joystick on your system.
If this occurs, check the throttle on the controller to assure
that it is at the center position. You may also want to make
sure the game controller is set up properly in Windows.

--------------------------
Reversed X-Axis and Y-Axis
--------------------------
The joystick X-Axis and Y-axis may appear to be reversed in the
game. If this occurs, check the Controller Options to remap it.
Check the + or – symbol in the mapping screen and change it to
the opposite of your current setting.
